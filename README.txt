Javascript Stylesheet is a responsive Framework plugin for Website Creation, in an easy-to-use graphical interface environment.

== Description ==
Javascript Stylesheet a website framework in a plugin.

Javascript Stylesheet is a plugin which allows you to go one step further with responsive websites. It will help you produce your websites faster. When you create websites using js-ss it takes everything into consideration - the size of an original image, the size of browser the user is using and the size of the paragraph that text is in - working with paragraph resizing when page sizing is changed and paragraphs change to be multiple lines changing their height. Everything is scaled to the pixel. It works with percentages but displays to the pixel so you know your website is always going to look the same no matter what the browser size. It also includes tablet and mobile sizing allowing you to scale separately for mobiles and tablets easily, without having to write separate lines of code.
